Walt Disney Company and their expected Implementation of AI

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Walt Disney Company

* When was the company incorporated?
1923

* Who are the founders of the company?
Walt Disney
Roy Disney

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
In an effort to cut costs, the Walt Disey Company began entertaining the idea of implementing AI.  According to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/technology/disney-creates-task-force-explore-ai-cut-costs-sources-2023-08-08/), the multinational entertainment conglomerate was offerring positiions in the artificial intelligence and machine learning field.  Areas of focus for these job openings ranged across all areas unter the companies interests; not jsut writing screenplays for the Sudio, but also engineering for theme parks and an enhanced advertisement system.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
As a mass media and entertainment conglomerate, their products include films, music, television, video games, as well as amusement parks across the globe.  Additionally they provide the related services in the entertainment industry such as broadcasting, licensing, publishing, radio, and most recently streaming (Disney+).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
It appears that the main goal of their AI implementation plans is to cut costs.  Recently, the company has gone through a turbulent time, with decreased attendance at their theme parks, and declining interest in their creative projects.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
From the start, their customer base was children and families. AS these families have grown, historically, their customer base also grew.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
For an most of the company's recent history, they have had very little competition in family entertainment and theme parks.  In fact, some argue Disney's recent struggles are partially due to the rise of several companies providing similar services.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Their theme parks have been utilizing Radio Frequency (RF) for several years with a number of their client services, and hardware tech development (MagicBands).  It's clear that hey have some machine learning built into their streaming service (Disney+), with its ability to recommend shows, cater to profiles, etc.



## Landscape

* What field is the company in
Burbank, CA

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?
Over the past 5-10 years, their quality in terms of their creative projects has not been as universally well received as it has been in the past. Additionally, with the introduction of "Wizarding World" at Universal Studios and Islands of adventure in Orlando, has led to lower attendance at Walt Disney World.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Universal Studios seems to be their most relevant competition

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The Walt Disney Company has made a huge impact on the word for many years. It would be difficult to name a company that has contributed more in terms of culture.
 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Attendance at parks, digital movie sales, and streamed hours seem to be the metrics of late. With theme parks, you also have merchandising sales. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest that they should focus on implementing AI in their engineering at the theme parks, both physical and digital architecture. Additionally, their main focus should be to provide the best experiece possible for every guest.  While it is difficult to accomplish that on an individual level, AI could help assist and at the same time aggregate data to continue to grow more and more capable.  A digital personal assitant.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The theme parks are struggling, attendance is down.  I think offering the digital personal assistant would help them provide the hospitality and service that seems to have also slightly degraded.  I think they could implement it similarly to how they use inputted data to "predict" guest's future in EPCOT's Spaceship Earth. Gaining that insight will not only proide a good experience, it ts data collection, which will help them improve and develop more exciting experiences.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This could range from an app, to a hotel concierge, or  within their rooms with hotel devices.  It would be a large language model that could understand complicated sentence structures and instructions.


* Why are thsee technologies appropriate for your solution?
Guest experiences can vary from person to person.  Having a flexible AGI model would be able to accomodate this wide ranging needs and desires of their guests.
